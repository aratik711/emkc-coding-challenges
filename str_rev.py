'''

Just take any given string and output it in reverse, pretty easy, right?

Your input variable could contain a variety of string values. Regardless of value, you'll need to reverse the string and print it out.

Sample Test Cases

Simple string
value1 cat
output tac

Complex string
value1 sd#$)(&*09&M0
output 0M&90*&()$#ds

'''

value1 = input()
print(value1[::-1])
